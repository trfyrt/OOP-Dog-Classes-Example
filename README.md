# Dog Classes in Java - An OOP Example with Inheritance

This repository demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, specifically focusing on the use of inheritance (`extends`). The project includes several dog breed classes that extend a base `Dogs` class, showcasing how inheritance and polymorphism can be implemented in Java. The `PetShop` class serves as the main entry point for running the application.

## Project Structure

- `Bulldog.java`
- `Chihuahua.java`
- `Dogs.java` (Parent class)
- `GermanShepard.java`
- `GoldenRetriever.java`
- `Komondor.java`
- `LabradorRetriever.java`
- `PetShop.java` (Main class)
- `Poodle.java`
- `Pug.java`
- `ShihTzu.java`
- `SiberianHusky.java`

## Classes Overview

- **Dogs.java**: This is the parent class that contains common properties and methods shared by all dog breeds.
- **PetShop.java**: This is the main class that contains the `main` method to run the application.
- **[Breed].java**: Each of these files (e.g., `Bulldog.java`, `Chihuahua.java`, etc.) represents a specific breed and extends the `Dogs` class.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-classes-java.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode).
3. Compile and run the `PetShop.java` class to see the program in action.

## Additional Notes

This project is a basic example of OOP in Java, intended for educational purposes. It demonstrates how to use inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes and how polymorphism can be utilized in Java applications.
